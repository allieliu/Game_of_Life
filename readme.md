Game of Life

Game of Life is a recreation of the original board game. The user will play against the computer, 
rolling dice to move around the board. The first player to reach the end of the board wins. 
However, there are certain obstacles. Two players cannot be on the same space, and some spaces will
send the player forward or backward.
